<div>
<p>The given string will be appended to the Trac website URL when you browse the source code.<br/>
   This is useful if you have multiple source code repositories under your trac website.</p>
  
  <p>Example:</p>
  If you change "src/main/myfile.py" in the source code repository "myRepo", normally the resulting URL is
  "http://trac.mycompany.com/browser/src/main/myfile.py".
  Depending on your Trac configuration you need this as and URL: 
  "http://trac.mycompany.com/browser/myrepo/src/main/myfile.py".<br/>
  To get the correct URL you need to enter "myrepo" into this field.</p>
