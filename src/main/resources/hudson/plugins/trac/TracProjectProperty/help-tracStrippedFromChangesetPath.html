<p>The given string will be removed from the path to the Trac website URL when you browse the source code.<br/>
   This is useful if you have a source code repositories with subfolders for projects.</p>
  
  <p>Example:</p>
  If you change "trunc/main/src/main/myfile.py" in the source code repository, normally the resulting URL is
  "http://trac.mycompany.com/browser/trunc/main/src/main/myfile.py".
  But because of your Trac configuration you need this as and URL: 
  "http://trac.mycompany.com/browser/src/main/myfile.py".<br/>
  To get the correct URL you need to enter "trunc/main" into this field, because this part will be removed the path.</p>
