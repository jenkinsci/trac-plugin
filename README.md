Jenkins Trac Plugin
===================

This plugin creates links from Hudson projects to [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.com/) instances.
The Trac plugin decorates Hudson "Changes" HTML to create links to your Trac wiki, tickets, changesets, and source browser.

See [Trac Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Trac+Plugin) on the Jenkins Wiki for more information.
